        <p class="about-me-paragraph">My name is Christine Than. I have always enjoy customizing and
            creating a new feel and look for websites. Apart of this project was to create
            and design a small fun game. I created a Battlestar Galactica Matching Card 
            Game Theme.
        </p>
        <p class="about-me-paragraph">For those who do not know what a Matching Card Game is, I will briefly paraphrase the game. A Matching card is 
            a game that requires mental stamina and concentration. The game itself can be a multiplayer game. However, my game requires only one. A player only has one 
        minute to finish matching all 18 cards. If the player does not finish matching the cards within a minute, the player will lose.If the player finishes matching all 18 cards within the one minute
    interval, he or she wins.</p>
